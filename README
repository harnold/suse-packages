This repository contains spec files and patches that can be used to build
RPM packages for the openSUSE distribution and some of its derivatives.

A package can be in this repository for one or more of the following
reasons:

1. the current openSUSE distribution does not provide a version of the
   package; or

2. I need a different version or a different configuration of the package
   than the one provided by the current openSUSE distribution; or

3. the version of the package in the current openSUSE distribution contains
   a bug that annoys me and that will not be fixed before the next release
   of the distribution.
